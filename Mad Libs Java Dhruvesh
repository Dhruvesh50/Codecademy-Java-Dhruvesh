	  This program generates a mad libbed Codecademy story.
	  Author: Dhruvesh
	  
	  This Mad Libbed program takes input from the user (builds on what was requested on Codecademy). 
	  
	  Use of AI:
	  - I used Grok xAI and ChatGPT to learn (things like """) and take some help/ hints. Used ChatGPT to find errors and took help to fix them if needed. 
	  - I was also going to use ChatGPT to simplify long, repetitive tasks like replacing " with """ (while keeping \" as it is) 
	  when I figured out that eclipse automatically puts + and two sets of speech marks in when I press enter (to put a new line). 
	  (I didn't use """ to split the paragraph as /n does it nicely anyways (and I wanted to make it easier to read and program for developer))
